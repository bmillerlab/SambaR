1.01	02_11_2020	NA
1.02	09_03_2021	inclusion of data quality plots when running genlight2sambar
1.02	09_03_2021	possibility to provide vectors with minor and major allele types (e.g. 1,2,3,4,0 or A,C,G,T,NA) when running genlight2sambar function 
1.02	09_03_2021	inclusion of mysambar$datasource
1.02	09_03_2021	added 'rlang' and 'vctrs' to list of packages to be installed
1.03	17_03_2021	bug fix concerning plots showing number of retained/discarded sites per filterclass 
1.03	17_03_2021	SFS vectors based on imputed data
1.03	17_03_2021	new SFS plot showing proportion of He sites per MAC class
1.03	17_03_2021	new method of data imputation for CA plots
1.03	17_03_2021	new columns in snps dataframe (i.e., allele counts per population)
1.03	17_03_2021	included regression line in Mantel plots
1.04	28_05_2021	mergepop() function
1.04	28_05_2021	admixtools f3 statistics
1.05	29_06_2021	new thinning algorithm (affecting snps$distfilter and snps$filter2 columns)
1.05	29_06_2021	new instructions for installing Bioconductor packages
1.05	29_06_2021	bug fix concerning GWDS thin option 
1.06	28_10_2021	bug fix concerning reordering of population distance matrix, leading to incorrect NJ population tree (getpoptree() function)
1.06	28_10_2021	NJ population tree analyses based on Reynolds genetic distance (Reynolds et al. 1983, ""Estimation of the coancestry coefficient: Basis for a short-term genetic distance"")   
1.06	28_10_2021	option 'retain' in excludepop() function, which allows to specify the populations to be retained (rather than the populations to be excluded)
1.06	28_10_2021	converting to pcadapt format directly from genlight rather than using a ped-file as intermediate - as a consequence SambaR no longer depends on (and no longer accepts) PCadapt version 4.1.0
1.06	18_12_2021	addition of 'quickrun' option to findstructure function
1.06	18_12_2021	addition of 'dapc_ellipse' and 'dapc_ellipse_level' options to findstructure function
1.06	18_12_2021	addition of 'domirroraxis' and 'axis_1' and 'axis_2' options to findstructure function
1.06	18_12_2021	addition to calckinship of geno2Dmat plots (showing genotype frequencies combinations among closely related samples) 
1.07	21_04_2021	optimal K estimation (now included in LEA admixture analyses)
1.07	21_04_2021	new distances: ASD, Euclidean; new methods: bionj, OLS, BME
1.07	21_04_2021	calculation of parsimony and likelihood scores
1.07	21_04_2021	comparison tree pathlength and genetic distance
1.07	21_04_2021	maximum likelihood tree and maximum parsimony tree
1.07	21_04_2021	as default in quickrun: Euclidean instead of Hamming. OLS/BME instead of UPGMA
1.07	21_04_2021	gene flow calculations in demography function
